# VGG16
My Pytorch Implementation of VGG16 based off of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf

Here is a sample of the classification on CIFAR-10 after just a few epochs of training:

# GAN

My Pytorch implementation of a Generative Adverserial Network is based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf

Below is an example of 25 randonly selected examples from the generator over 15 epochs of training on the MNIST dataset:
